Bug fixes:
- GetModuleAttribute: if the attribute requested is defined but set to null then the task does not attempt to create a property. This is prohibited by Ant's PropertyHelper.
- GetModulePath: a BuildException is thrown is the module path is undefined.
- ManifestModuleLoader uses ModuleLoader#normalisePath(String) to normalise module paths.

API changes:
- ModuleLoader#normalisePath(String) is introduced to implement consistent path normalisation.
- ModuleInfo: the constructor ModuleInfo(String) is replaced with ModuleInfo(String, ModuleLoader) to make it possible to normalise paths against the module loader passed.
- SerialDependencyResolver: #moduleProcessed() throws IllegalArgumentException if the module is not null and no module is being processed (was: IllegalStateException).
- An empty string is considered a defined callTargetForModules/moduleProperty value.
- ManifestModuleLoader: the attribute manifestEntry is added which defines the name of the manifest entry to load module metadata from. By default the main entry is used (was: the entry "Build").

Other:
- API documentation is expanded.
- CallTargetForModules (in the parallel mode) interrupts helper threads and waits for them to finish if the build thread is interrupted to ensure that the build finishes rapidly and the 'build failed' message is the last message displayed.
- CallTargetForModules#setModuleProperty() overrides properties defined by #createParam().
- CallTargetForModules#addConfigured(ModuleLoader) throws NullPointerException if null module loader is passed.
- ModuleUtil#normalisePath(String, File) is added to support ModuleLoader#normalisePath(String).

0.4.0

Bug fixes:
- GetModuleAttribute, GetModuleClasspath, GetModulePath: if an output property is defined then it is not replaced with the value generated by the task.
- CallTargetForModules: a single param is created to set the module to call the target for.
- ManifestModuleLoader reads classpath attributes and dependencies as URLs, not URIs.
- ManifestModuleLoader: a usage of Ant 1.7-specific API is replaced with Ant 1.6-compatible functionality.
- ManifestModuleLoader: ModuleNotLoadedException is thrown instead of a RuntimeException if a malformed URL element is present in a module manifest.
- GetModuleClasspath supports now nested <sourceAttribute> elements.

API changes:
- Module and ModuleInfo are made final classes.
- Module is made thread-safe for the clients.
- Module#addDependency and Module#setDependencies visibility is reduced from 'public' to 'package'.
- CallTargetForModules: the attribute 'threadCount' is added to define a number of threads which are to execute targets for independent modules.
- CallTargetForModules: the API of the element 'param' is limited to the API of the Property type of Ant 1.6.
- CallTargetForModules: at least one <module> element is required now.
- CallTargetForModules: the attribute 'target' is added to the element <module> to support module-specific targets invoked by CallTargetForModules.

Other:
- API documentation is expanded.
- The worst-case performance of SerialDependencyResolver is improved (was: O(n^4), now: O(n^3)).
- Error messages that report about an build failure in a module target now displayed with the module path.
- Location in the build file is reported in case of cyclic dependencies and module not loaded errors.

0.2.0

- Initial release.

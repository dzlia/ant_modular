/**
 * <p>An entity that represents a single module in a multi-module environment. Each
 * module is identified by its {@link #getPath() path} relative to the root directory
 * of this environment. In addition, each module has metadata associated with it.
 * This metadata consists of {@link #getDependencies() dependencies} and
 * {@link #getAttributes() attributes}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The module dependencies is a set of modules which this module dependens upon.
 * Typically the dependee modules should be processed before this module can be
 * processed.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The module attributes are named pieces of data of free format. Attribute names
 * are case-sensitive. The {@code null} name is not allowed. An attribute value can be
 * any object or {@code null}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Each {@code Module} is built from its prototype &ndash; a {@link ModuleInfo} object.
 * The dependency paths defined in the latter are converted into {@code Module} instances
 * and assigned to the module instance and the attributes are copied with no transformation.
 * {@code Module} has neither public nor protected constructors.
 * {@link ModuleRegistry#resolveModule(String)} is to be used to get an instance of
 * {@code Module} for a given path.</p>
 * 
 * <p>{@code Module} is technically not thread-safe. However, it can be used without
 * synchronisation from any thread once it is exposed to the client of the Ant Modular
 * library. Note that synchronising upon <em>attributes</em> is needed in some cases
 * (refer to {@link #getDependencies()} for more details).</p>
